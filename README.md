1. <b>Step 1:</b> The function iterates through the input dictionary D, extracting the day of the week for each date key (using getDayOfWeek). It sums the corresponding values for each day and stores them in the result dictionary.


2. <b>Step 2:</b> If any day in the result dictionary has no entries (i.e., its value is still 0), the algorithm calculates the mean of the previous and next days in the week and assigns it to the missing day.
